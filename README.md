# Inventory-App

Inventory App

An inventory application that creates/reads/updates/deletes parts and products.  The parts can be associated with user-selected product instances.  An abstract Parts class was implemented to classify the parts.
Javadocs were then written for the entire project.

The application was written in the Java language and created on JetBrains IntelliJ.

Challenges:
-Adding/Removing parts to specific products.  Required the additional lists to do so.

Future Implementations:
-A more attractive GUI for user experience.
-A relational database to store the parts and products.
